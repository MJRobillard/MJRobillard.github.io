My personal portfolio Website! The home page was used using bootstrap aswell as the carousels on the tech tree portfolio page. I'm really proud of the tech tree as its design and pretty much everything except for the carousel was made by me. Of course it doesn't look like a standard website. But thats the point, I wanted to stand out by doing something unconventional. Did it work? Yes!. Is it as flawless as standard practices? No. But by doing so I demonstrate my ability to code in javascript dynamically rather then relying on prebuilt frameworks.
